In 2011, El Rubius released the famous parody "Minero" with producer StarkinDJ, based on Chayanne's song "Torero." The lyrics humorously describe the life of a miner in Minecraft, facing creepers, searching for diamonds, and surviving in a world full of dangers, all in Rubius's signature style. The song became a viral phenomenon within the Spanish-speaking gaming community, especially among Minecraft fans, and its official music video remains one of the most memorable pieces from his early years on YouTube, showcasing how Rubius combined humor, music, and the ability to create his own unique video.</html>
